      <p>Hey guys ðŸ‘‹</p>
    </div>
    <p>I thought this would be a more clear medium to express and explain my thoughts ðŸ”« hopefully you also end up feeling that way</p>

    <p>
      On 4/6/2022 I was in an outdoors area with my brother, social distancing it up in our panedemic lifestyle.
      I managed to avoid having him sneeze in my face in the duration of our time together
    </p>
    <p class="wavy-js">However!</p>
    <p>
      I noticed he had a bit of a sniffle, and after he took a covid test, it turns out he was positive ðŸ˜± <br>
      We are both vax'd up and were in an outdoor setting, so I am not incredibly concerned, however I am paying
      close attention to my health just in case and am thinking of our D&amp;D session on 4/10/2022 <br>
      from my understanding, symptoms would usually show within 4 days, so in my mind I was thinking I would test the morning of
      our planned session, and then make a decision the day of. Maybe test on day 3 and 4 for more accurate results.<br>
    </p>
    <div class="bats"></div>
    <p>
      My main concern is that this may lead to canceling the day of planned events ðŸ¤” <span class="imp">in which case it would be better if
      instead of testing the day of, to just reschedule.</span><br>
      <br>
      Please let me know your thoughts!
    </p>
